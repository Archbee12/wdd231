      <h2>Site Name</h2>
      <p>BYUI Cloned</p>
      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this project is to design and build a personalized, student-centered portal inspired by the official BYU-Idaho portal. This site will serve as both a functional homepage and a course documentation tool, providing an organized and visually familiar interface that mimics the original BYUI student experience.</p>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project will replicate key design elements of the BYUI portal to create a customized student dashboard. The homepage will feature navigation links, a welcome section, and a layout similar to the official portal. In addition to the visual clone, this site will include a Courses section where I will document all the courses I am taking. Each course will display details such as the course name, description, credits. Users will be able to click on course cards to view more information in a modal dialog.</p>
      <h3>Planned Enhancement</h3>
      <p>To improve functionality and interactivity, I will be extending the class-schedule.html page to include:</p>
      <p>✅ Add/Drop Course Feature:
        Students will be able to add new courses from a selection list or remove previously added courses from their schedule. This will simulate a basic course registration system.</p>
      <p>✅ Local Storage Integration:
        Selected courses will be stored in the browser’s localStorage to maintain user choices across sessions.</p>
      <p>✅ User Feedback:
        Buttons will update in real-time (e.g., "Add" → "Added", disabled after click) to improve UX.</p>
      <p>The site will be fully responsive, accessible, and structured using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan to implement features such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A dynamic homepage layout inspired by BYUI's portal design.</li>
        <li>A course documentation area with interactive modals.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript functionality for fetching and displaying course data from a JSON file.</li>
        <li>Modern front-end practices like modular JavaScript, local storage, and DOM manipulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project not only demonstrates my web development skills but also serves as a personal academic organizer.</p>
      <h2>Target Market</h2>
